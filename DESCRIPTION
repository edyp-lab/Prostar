Description: This package provides a GUI interface for the DAPAR package. The 
    package Prostar (Proteomics statistical analysis with R) is a Bioconductor 
    distributed R package which provides all the necessary functions to 
    analyze quantitative data from label-free proteomics experiments. 
    Contrarily to most other similar R packages, it is endowed with rich and 
    user-friendly graphical interfaces, so that no programming skill is 
    required.
